* Fork the repository to a safe location on your hard drive and pull every time you want to work on it.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Comment out all new code additions and write out new additions in commit messages.
* After you finish what you wanted to work on, commit the changes you made and write a brief message explaining what you did. Then push your changes to the server. 

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Project Lead: Billy Brawner billybrawner@gmail.com

### Current Features ###

* Generate a random workout for a user.
* Take into account the number of days per week they want to/are able to work out.
* Muscles accounted for in the workout: chest, back, legs, triceps, biceps, shoulders, forearms, calves, abs.
* Take into account a user's goals (Strength, Endurance, Hypertrophy.)
* Take into account a user's preference (Free weights, selectorized equipment, or cable equipment.)
* Save routine to a file for easy access later.

### Possible future features ###

* Include rest and tempo into the format.
* Take into account a user's fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and modify the workout given accordingly.
* Allow user to input how many sets, reps, and weight for each exercise completed in order to track their progress.
* Allow user to substitute individual exercises in their list.
* Remember weight used for each exercise in previous workouts if the user has input them afterwards and suggest the highest weight used for each.
* Convert to a web app or native mobile app for use on phones/tablets (maybe both, since Apple is super strict on their app acceptance policy.)
