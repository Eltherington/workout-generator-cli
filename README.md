* Make sure you're using Python 3.4.3.
* Fork the repository to a safe location on your hard drive and pull every time you want to work on it.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Comment out all new code additions and write out new additions in commit messages.
* After you finish what you wanted to work on, commit the changes you made and write a brief message explaining what you did. Then push your changes to the server. 

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Project Lead: Billy Brawner billybrawner@gmail.com

### Possible future features ###

* Take into account a user's fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and modify the workout give accordingly.
* Save routine to a file for easy access later.
* Allow user to input how may sets, reps, and weight for each exercise completed in order to track their progress.
* Allow user to substitute individual exercises in their list.
* Remember weight used for each exercise in previous workouts if the user has input them afterwards and suggest the highest weight used for each.
* Convert to a web app or native mobile app for use on phones/tablets (maybe both, since Apple is super strict on their app acceptance policy.)
